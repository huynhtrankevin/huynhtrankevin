          About Us
        </div>
        <p>
          Our team developed this product under UC Santa Barbara’s Engineering program as an interdisciplinary capstone project. This project was inspired by a young and inventive 7th grade girl, Sophie, who had a vision of transforming the lives of others like her that have been diagnosed with CP. Her brilliance was discovered by Professor Tyler Susko at one of his engineering outreach programs at a local middle school. The students were tasked with designing a solution to a problem and Sophie submitted the blueprints to a device that would enable her and others like her to walk independently without the assistance of an aid. Touched by this, Professor Susko recruited a team of engineering students at UCSB to realize Sophie’s design. Over the course of nine inspiring months, our team worked tirelessly to deliver the LegTrek. From the technical features to the ergonomics of the device, our implementation and design choices are backed by rigorous testing and feedback from Sophie, her aid, and her physical therapist. Because of the sound engineering we applied to developing this solution to a very real problem, our team was awarded best capstone project. While our team’s participation in capstone is over, we are still working with Sophie and her physical therapist to improve the device to a state where it can be used in her therapists’ clinic. Moving forward from capstone, we wish to continue to develop this device to bring it to market so that others like Sophie can benefit from the independence our LegTrek promises.
